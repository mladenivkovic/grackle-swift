# Grackle-Swift

This is a fork of the [grackle](https://github.com/grackle-project/grackle)
library, intended to keep a frozen version of the library which is known and
tested to work with GEAR-RT in [swift](https://github.com/SWIFTSIM/swiftsim)
publicly available.

All installation instructions and dependencies remain identical to the upstream
Grackle package. The upstream Grackle readme is shown below.

There a script is included to set up grackle on cosma (8) with the Intel 2021
compiler suite. Look through `src/clib/Make.mach.cosma8-intel2021` and check
that all paths are set correctly and up to date. Then run `src/clib/myinstall.sh`.
(Don't forget to first run ./configure).


## Grackle-Swift as a spack package

Additionally, I've added the relevant files to make grackle-swift available as a
[spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) package. It is however not part of the
spack repository, so it needs a few easy steps to set up. This way of installing
it is valid for newer versions of spack (~v1.0). For old instructions, see below.

First, get my fork of the spack-packages repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mladenivkovic/spack-packages.git ~/spack-packages
```

or

```
git clone git@github.com:mladenivkovic/spack-packages.git ~/spack-packages
```

Next, navigate into the repo and check out the `grackle-swift` branch:

```
$ cd ~/grackle-swift
$ git checkout grackle-swift
```

Then tell spack to use that repository as its database:

```
$ spack repo set --destination ~/spack-packages builtin
```

Finally, install grackle-swift the way you would install any other package with spack. E.g.

```
$ spack install grackle-swift
```

or

```
$ spack install grackle-swift ^hdf5@1.14.6 %gcc@15.1.0
```



### Old instructions

In older versions of spack (before ~2025, ~v0.23), it was sufficient to copy the
contents of a directory into the spack repository, and that was that. I'm keeping
these instructions in case somebody is still using the older versions.

The installation is straightforward:

- Copy the directory `/grackle-swift/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/grackle-swift`
and its contents into the corresponding directory in your spack clone (in the
spack clone, the directory `/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages` should exist
by default. That's where spack keeps all its packages.)
- **IMPORTANT**: Copy and use the files stored in the `main` branch. Do not use
the files stored in the `freeze` branch. (Spack requires an md5sum to verify the
integrity of the downloaded files. The stored md5sum in the `freeze` branch will
be wrong, and spack will refuse to install it. Correcting the md5sum on the `freeze`
branch changes its md5sum, making it wrong again. So that won't work.)
- install grackle-swift the way you would install any other package with spack. E.g.
```
$ spack install grackle-swift
```
or
```
$ spack install grackle-swift ^hdf5@1.12.2 %gcc@12.1.0
```
or ...


NOTE: The file was changed to work with `spack` for spack's `develop` branch on commit
`5f58a4c0792071ca4e681e43724fe7c66c2cefce`

Grackle is a chemistry and radiative cooling library for astrophysical
simulations and models.  Grackle has interfaces for C, C++, Fortran, and
Python codes and provides:

- two options for primordial chemistry and cooling:

   1. non-equilibrium primordial chemistry network for atomic H, D, and He
   as well as H<sub>2</sub> and HD, including H<sub>2</sub> formation on dust grains.

   2. tabulated H and He cooling rates calculated with the photo-ionization
      code, [Cloudy](http://nublado.org).

- tabulated metal cooling rates calculated with [Cloudy](http://nublado.org).

- photo-heating and photo-ionization from two UV backgrounds with optional
  self-shielding corrections:

   1. [Faucher-Giguere et al. (2009)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...703.1416F).

   2. [Haardt & Madau (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...746..125H).

- support for user-provided arrays of volumetric and specific heating rates.

The Grackle provides functions to update chemistry species; solve radiative
cooling and update internal energy; and calculate cooling time, temperature,
pressure, and ratio of specific heats (gamma).

For more information on features, installation, and integration with simulation
codes and models, see our [online documentation](https://grackle.readthedocs.io/).
